 + Output the number of generations for each test run of MOC
 - Configure IRACE for each alg x model pairing
 - Calculate average number of generations for a default run of MOC across 2250 data points (as part
   of resilience tests): Use this for max generations in the lexicographic comparisons
 - Disable stopping condition for any runs with lexicographic selection
 - Final tournament for final population of lexicographic GA: Return a single CF
 - Restructure testing bed to include both resilience and lexicographic testing
 - Incorporate resilience into fitness function

TESTS:

Pareto vs. Lexicographic (default)
Pareto vs. Lexicographic (+ Resilience)
